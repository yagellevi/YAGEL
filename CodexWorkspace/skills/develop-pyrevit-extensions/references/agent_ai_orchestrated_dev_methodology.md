# AI-Orchestrated Development Methodology (pyRevit)



This is the single canonical usage guide for this template. Use it to minimize cognitive load while building pyRevit extensions with a dual-model workflow.



## Model Roles

- gpt-5.2: planning, task generation, review, backlog, and next-feature analysis.

- gpt-5.2-codex: implementation of code changes and documentation updates.



## Static vs Workspace Files

- Static guidance lives in [`references/`](docs_overview.md) (workflow, prompting, pyRevit guides, checklists) and [`assets/`](../assets/) (prompts, templates).
- Project-specific planning artifacts live in [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/`](../../../workspace/).

## Core Artifacts

- [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/development.md`](../../../workspace/development.md): canonical architecture, milestones, and constraints.

- Code-Tasks: implementation tasks for gpt-5.2-codex.

- Ask-Tasks: review/analysis tasks for gpt-5.2.

- [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/backlog.md`](../../../workspace/backlog.md): non-urgent work captured for later.

- [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/plans/`](../../../workspace/plans/): plain-language plans that seed the workflow.



## Quick Start

1. Copy [`plan_template.md`](../assets/templates/plan_template.md) to [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/plans/`](../../../workspace/plans/) and name it `<feature>_plan.md`.
2. Run the Planning prompt with gpt-5.2 to create [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/development.md`](../../../workspace/development.md).

3. Run the Seed Code-Tasks prompt with gpt-5.2 to generate the first task batch.

4. Execute each Code-Task with gpt-5.2-codex (code and docs in the same task).

5. Run the Review Ask-Task prompt with gpt-5.2 after the batch merges.

6. Use Iteration prompts if gaps or conflicts appear.

7. Capture non-urgent tasks using the Backlog prompt into [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/backlog.md`](../../../workspace/backlog.md).

8. Run the Next Feature prompt when the current feature is complete.



## Phase Map

| Phase | Trigger | Model | Prompt File | Expected Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | New repo or new feature | gpt-5.2 | [`planning_phase_prompt.txt`](../assets/prompts/planning_phase_prompt.txt) | [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/development.md`](../../../workspace/development.md) |
| Seeding | Plan accepted | Manual | (none) | Repo structure seeded |
| First Step Implementation | Start first feature | gpt-5.2 | [`seed_code_tasks_prompt.txt`](../assets/prompts/seed_code_tasks_prompt.txt) | Code-Tasks batch |
| Review | Task batch merged | gpt-5.2 | [`review_ask_task_prompt.txt`](../assets/prompts/review_ask_task_prompt.txt) | Gap report + remediation |
| Iteration I | In-flight conflicts | gpt-5.2 | [`iteration_task_adjust_prompt.txt`](../assets/prompts/iteration_task_adjust_prompt.txt) | Adjusted tasks |
| Iteration II | Post-batch gaps | gpt-5.2 | [`iteration_summary_tasks_prompt.txt`](../assets/prompts/iteration_summary_tasks_prompt.txt) | Additional Code-Tasks |
| Backlog | Non-urgent tasks found | gpt-5.2 | [`backlog_code_task_prompt.txt`](../assets/prompts/backlog_code_task_prompt.txt) | [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/backlog.md`](../../../workspace/backlog.md) updated |
| Next Feature | Roadmap advance | gpt-5.2 | [`next_feature_ask_task_prompt.txt`](../assets/prompts/next_feature_ask_task_prompt.txt) | Next feature recommendation |
| Implementation | Start next feature | gpt-5.2 | [`iteration_summary_tasks_prompt.txt`](../assets/prompts/iteration_summary_tasks_prompt.txt) | New Code-Tasks batch |



## Code-Task Rules (Implementation)

- Scope limit: 3 hours max, roughly 100 LoC.

- Must include explicit file paths and responsibilities.

- Must include documentation updates as first-class requirements.

- Must include validation commands.

- Must follow target Revit version patterns (explicit transactions, .NET collections at API boundaries).



## Ask-Task Rules (Review)

- Technical findings only (no code generation).

- Include file and line references.

- Prioritize recommendations by severity.

- Validate completeness against [`CodexWorkspace/workspace/development.md`](../../../workspace/development.md).



## Prompt Library

All prompts are stored in [`CodexWorkspace/skills/develop-pyrevit-extensions/assets/prompts/`](../assets/prompts/). Use the model indicated in each prompt file and keep the output format unchanged. Replace `{REVIT_VERSION}` with the target release.



## Documentation Hygiene

- Update README and relevant docs in the same task that changes behavior.

- Keep docstrings current for new or edited functions.

- Keep [`docs_overview.md`](docs_overview.md) and [`prompts_overview.md`](prompts_overview.md) up to date.



## Validation and Checklists

- Review work against [`checklists_overview.md`](checklists_overview.md) before merging.
- Use the appropriate versioned Revit skill (e.g., [`pyrevit-revit-2023`](../../pyrevit-revit-2023/), [`pyrevit-revit-2024`](../../pyrevit-revit-2024/), [`pyrevit-revit-2025`](../../pyrevit-revit-2025/)) for API decisions.

## Git Cadence (Short)

- Open a PR after the first Code-Task of a feature.

- Keep pushing follow-up tasks to the same PR.

- Do not merge until the Review Ask-Task passes and backlog items are captured.
